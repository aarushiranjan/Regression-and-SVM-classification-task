# Regression-and-SVM-classification-task
Polynomial Curve Fitting &amp; Genomic Sequence Analysis assignments completed. Utilized linear regression, error functions, &amp; regularization for curve fitting. Evaluated overfitting, noise variance, &amp; performance with full dataset. Trained SVM with linear &amp; Gaussian kernels using LIBSVM for genomic analysis, 5-fold CV for parameter selection.
