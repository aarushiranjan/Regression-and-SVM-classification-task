# Regression-and-SVM-classification-task
Polynomial Curve Fitting:
In this assignment, the goal is to fit a polynomial curve to a dataset of (x, y) pairs using linear regression. We are given a personalized input file with 100 data points. The objective is to find the best-fitting polynomial degree and its coefficients, as well as estimating the noise variance. We experiment with various error functions to minimize the error between the fitted curve and the data points. Regularization techniques are also explored to prevent overfitting. The results are presented through visualizations and interpretation.

Genomic Sequence Analysis:
This assignment involves detecting non-coding ribonucleic acids (ncRNAs) using supervised classification. We have an 8-dimensional feature vector for each genomic sequence, including sequence length and nucleotide frequencies. The task is to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to determine if a sequence is an ncRNA. We use the LIBSVM toolbox and perform linear SVM classification first, adjusting the regularization parameter C. Then, we use the Gaussian (RBF) kernel SVM with 5-fold cross-validation to select the best C and Ïƒ values. Test data classification is performed using the trained SVM model. The results are summarized in a report alongside the implementation code.
